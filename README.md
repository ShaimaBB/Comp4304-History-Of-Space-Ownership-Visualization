# Comp4304-History-Of-Space-Ownership-Visualization


**COMP 4304 – Data Visualization Course Project**  
🎓 Memorial University | 🌌 Johnson Geo Centre Exhibition

## 📌 Overview

This project explores the shifting power dynamics in space exploration—how satellite ownership evolved from government and military monopolies during the Cold War to a decentralized, commercialized space economy dominated by private corporations.

Using real satellite data from the GCAT catalog, we investigate:
- What historic events triggered spikes in satellite launches?
- How did ownership patterns change from 1957 to the present?
- What role did private companies begin to play in the 21st century?

We deliver our findings via a professionally designed **infographic**, an **interactive dashboard**, and a **video presentation** aimed at educating the public at the Johnson Geo Centre’s “Our Future & Space” exhibit.

### ✅ Interactive Dashboard
Developed using Dash:
- **3 dynamic visualizations**
- **4+ UI controls** (Dropdowns, Sliders, Toggles)
- Filter by organization type, year, country, and purpose
- Explore spike years and launch trends interactively

### 📊 Key Insights
- 1950–1980s: Space dominated by superpower governments (USA, USSR)
- Post-9/11: Surge in government surveillance & defense satellites
- Post-2019: Rapid commercial expansion (e.g., SpaceX, OneWeb)
- Private Sector: More efficient, innovative, and cost-effective than traditional government launches
